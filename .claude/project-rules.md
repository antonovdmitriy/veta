# Project Rules for Veta

## Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** Never commit or push changes without explicit permission from the user.

- Always wait for the user to say "комит" or "пуш" before running git commands
- Do not automatically commit after completing tasks
- Do not assume permission to push to remote repository

## Development Guidelines

- Use SwiftUI and SwiftData for iOS 17+
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Keep solutions simple and focused - avoid over-engineering
- Test changes before committing

## Communication

- Respond in Russian when the user writes in Russian
- Be concise and direct
- Only use emojis if explicitly requested by the user
